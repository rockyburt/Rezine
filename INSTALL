TextPress 0.1 Alpha Installation Instructions
=============================================

For a working TextPress instance you need to have the following libraries
installed:

  - Werkzeug from Mercurial: hg clone http://dev.pocoo.org/hg/werkzeug-main
  - Jinja from Mercurial: hg clone http://dev.pocoo.org/hg/jinja-main
  - SQLAlchemy 0.4 or higher*
  - simplejson*
  - Python 2.4 or higher
  - A database (MySQL, SQLite or PostgreSQL and others are supported)
  - pytz*

Libraries marked with * are installable from the cheeseshop via easy_install or
might be available in Debian already.

For a quickstart with the development server do this:

    $ mkdir instance
    $ python textpress-management.py runserver 

After the first start you will find yourself in an installation wizard that
helps you to create the database tables and anan  administrator account.

To get access to a python console with the textpress instance context do this:

    $ python textpress-management.py shell

Note that if your instance folder is not named "instance" or is not stored in this directory
you have to set the environment variable TEXTPRESS_INSTANCE to get TextPress working.
