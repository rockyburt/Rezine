Zine 0.1 Alpha Installation Instructions
========================================

For a working Zine instance you need to have the following libraries
installed:

  - Python 2.4 or higher
  - Werkzeug*
  - Jinja2*
  - A database (MySQL, SQLite or PostgreSQL and others are supported)
  - SQLAlchemy 0.5 [revision>=5491] or higher*
  - simplejson* [included in Python 2.6 and higher]
  - pytz*
  - Babel*

Libraries marked with * are installable from the cheeseshop via easy_install or
might be available in Debian already.

If you might use easy_install:

    $ easy_install Werkzeug Jinja2 MySQL-python SQLAlchemy simplejson pytz Babel

For a quickstart with the development server do this:

    $ mkdir instance
    $ ./scripts/server -I instance

After the first start you will find yourself in an installation wizard that
helps you to create the database tables and an administrator account.

To get access to a python console with the zine instance context do this:

    $ ./scripts/shell

Note that if your instance folder is not named "instance" or is not stored in
this directory or if you are not below the instance folder you have to provide
the path to it as argument to the scripts using the "-I" parameter.
