===================================
Rezine - a Python powered blog engine
===================================

Overview
========

Rezine provides quite a few features:

- of course, basic blog functionality: posting, comments, categories,
  tags, and ATOM feeds
- user, group and permission management
- theming support
- importers for WordPress and Atom feeds.
- an advanced plugin system
- a translatable interface (although with this first release, only
  English and German translations are available)

Installation
============

Simple to install via ``easy_install``::

    $ easy_install Rezine

*To install lxml you may need the development packages of libxml2 and libxslt*

mod_wsgi
--------

The following example shows how to set up Rezine for `mod_wsgi`.

1.  Create a new folder `/var/rezine/yourblog` where `yourblog` is a name
    that make sense for you.
2.  Copy the `rezine.wsgi` file from
    `/path/to/python/lib/python/site-packages/rezine/servers`
    into the newly created folder and open it with an editor.
3.  Modify the `INSTANCE_FOLDER` variable to point to the `yourblog` folder.
4.  Open your Apache vhost config or your Apache config, whatever you use
    and add the following lines::

        WSGIScriptAlias /yourblog /var/lib/rezine/yourblog/rezine.wsgi

    This tells Apache that it should hook your blog into the webserver at
    `/yourblog`.  You can also move it to a different vhost and mount it
    in the root or ask Apache to spawn as different user.  More details
    about that are available in the `mod_wsgi documentation`_.
5.  Make sure the user your Apache (or application if you configured a
    different user for mod_wsgi) has read and write access to the
    `yourblog` folder.
6.  Reload your apache and go to the URL of your blog and follow the
    installation instructions.

Development Quickstart
----------------------

For a quickstart with the development server do this::

    $ mkdir yourblog
    $ rezine-manage -I yourblog

After the first start you will find yourself in an installation wizard
that helps you to create the database tables and an administrator
account.
