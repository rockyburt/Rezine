===================================
Zine - a Python powered blog engine
===================================

This is Zine 0.1, the first stable release of Zine.
It already provides quite a few features:

 - of course, basic blog functionality: posting, comments, categories, tags,
   and ATOM feeds
 - user, group and permission management
 - theming support
 - importers for WordPress and blogger.com blogs as well as Atom feeds.
 - an advanced plugin system
 - a translatable interface (although with this first release, only English and
   German translations are available)

But some things are still missing.  The following things (and more) will be
included in Zine 0.2 (tentatively set to be released on April 1, 2009):

 - search functionality
 - file upload system
 - notifications about new posts, comments, etc
 - more translations
 - documentation for (plugin) developers (for now, there's a documented example
   plugin called Eric The Fish included in Zine's source. If you want to
   develop plugins, that's the starting point.)

Getting in touch with the developers
====================================

The best way to communicate with the developers is the IRC channel #pocoo on
irc.freenode.net.  Beware, several projects have their "home" there, so be
sure to tell the people you're talking about Zine.

The Zine development page is at http://dev.pocoo.org/projects/zine/.  It
includes a bugtracker.  If you find a bug, have a patch or want to suggest
a feature, you can use that tracker.

Zine's Mercurial repository is located at http://dev.pocoo.org/hg/zine-main/.
There also is an official mirror on Bitbucket, at
http://www.bitbucket.org/mitsuhiko/zine-main/.
