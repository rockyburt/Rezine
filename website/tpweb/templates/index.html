<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
  <strong>TextPress</strong> is a personal publishing platform aka web log
  engine written in Python.  It's OpenSource, free and developed with a focus
  on security and usability.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the <a href="${url_for('about/features.html')}">features</a> include:
</p>
<ul id="featurelist">
  <li><strong>Valid HTML4</strong>.  While it looked like XHTML would become
      the standard for long time, HTML is getting a lot of attention lately again.
      The reason for this is the current bad support of XHTML in browsers
      and the huge number of pages with an XHTML doctype but HTML4 contents.
      TextPress currently sticks to HTML4 and we will make the switch to
      either HTML5 / XHTML5 of XHTML2, depending on what will best supported
      at that time.</li>
  <li><strong>Atom support</strong>.  TextPress supports the most recent
      <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/">Atom standard</a> for best
      interoperability with other applications and web services.</li>
  <li><strong>Extensible</strong>.  TextPress is build on a solid core that
      is extensible by plugins.  These plugins can extend nearly every part
      of the application.</li>
  <li><strong>Pingback support</strong>.  TextPress comes with full support
      for <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback">pingback</a>
      for cross-blog communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple Web Setup</strong>.  The initial web setups helps you
      getting TextPress running in less than two minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Simplified HTML</strong>.  As blog author you often want to
      write the HTML for your blog posts on your own but want to have
      automatic paragraphs or some other helpers (such as automatically
      escaped text inside <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>-tags).  TextPress comes
      with an intelligent algorithm that ensures your code is valid HTML on
      the one hand, and easy to write on the other.</li>
