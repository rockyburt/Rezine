<h2>Community</h2>
<p>
  The most important thing for a successful Open Source project is a good
  and vibrant community.  You can help TextPress not only by writing plugins
  or hacking on the core code, but also by just blogging about it and letting
  people know that it exists.
</p>
<p>
  If you are blogging about TextPress, send us a mail and we add you to the
  <a href="${url_for('community/planet')}">planet</a> which aggregates blogs
  by the TextPress developers and TextPress users that want to share their
  experiences.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to talk with the TextPress developers or some TextPress users?
  <a href="${url_for('community/irc.html')}">our IRC Channel</a> with your
  favourite IRC client and chat about the future of TextPress, ask questions
  and get help.
