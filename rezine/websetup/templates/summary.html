    Rezine knows now about all the information it needs to setup your
    instance. After you click on the install button Rezine will create
    the database tables and insert the default information. Right after that
    Rezine will be online in maintenance mode which means that it's only
    visible to the administrator, all other users will get a message that
    shows that the blog is in maintenance mode right now.
