Server Information
==================

This folder contains scripts for various deployment types.  Depending
on the kind of Webserver and Webserver interface you should chose one
of them or create your own.

The following files exist currently:

`zine.cgi`
    This file implements can be used to use Zine over CGI.  This
    should *NOT* be used unless you have to.  Zine is not designed
    for the run-once nature of CGI and will perform poorly on it.

`zine.fcgi`
    This file serves Zine over FastCGI.  It requires the flup
    module for Python.

`zine.wsgi`
    This file can be used to execute Zine over mod_wsgi.

Just take the file of choice, copy it to where you want it to be and
adjust it.
