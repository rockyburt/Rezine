    Here you can dump your Zine database information into an standardized
    format (Atom) with Zine extensions which we call “Zine eXtended
    Atom” (ZineXA).  You can use this file to import your posts into another
    weblog software that supports Atom.  You should not use this file for
    Zine migrations as this file will not include attachments, the blog
    configuration and probably data stored by plugins.

    Please keep in mind that the exported file will contain confidential
    information such as password hashes and database passwords from the
    configuration.
