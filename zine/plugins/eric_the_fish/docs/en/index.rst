Eric The Fish Documentation
===========================

About Eric
----------
Eric The Fish is a documented example plugin.  It serves as a starting
point for people interested in Zine plugin development.
All the plugin does is to display an annoying fish that says random
fortunes in the lower right corner of the administration interface, but
that illustrates a lot of Zine plugin functionality, e.g. custom
configuration pages.

About this documentation page
-----------------------------
As the rest of the plugin, the documentation also is mainly an example --
this time for documenting plugins.  You can build the docs from source
using the ``build-documentation`` script distributed with Zine::

	$ ./scripts/build-documentation zine/plugins/eric_the_fish

After that, it shows up in the plugin section of the online help (that's
what you're looking at right now).
