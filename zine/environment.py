    zine.environment
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This module can figure how Zine is installed and where it has to look
    for shared information.  Currently it knows about two modes: development
    environment and installation on a posix system.  OS X should be special
    cased later and Windows support is missing by now.

    File Locations
    --------------

    The files are located at different places depending on the environment.

    development
        in development mode all the files are relative to the zine
        package::

            zine/                           application code
                plugins/                    builtin plugins
                shared/                     core shared data
                templates/                  core templates
                i18n/                       translations

    posix
        On a posix system (including Linux) the files are distributed to
        different locations on the file system below the prefix which is
        /usr in the following example::

            /usr/lib/zine/
                zine/                       application code
                plugins/                    builtin plugins with symlinks
                                            to stuff in /usr/share/zine
            /usr/share/zine/
                htdocs/core                 core shared data
                templates/core              core templates
                i18n/                       translations
